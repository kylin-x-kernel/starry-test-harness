fuzzing can:

Detect bugs and vulnerabilities that may be hard to find with unit testing, integration testing, code review, and other security testing methods.

Test your system's robustness and resilience against malicious or unexpected input and help prevent potential cyberattacks or exploits.

Increase the code coverage and test coverage of your system and reveal edge cases and corner cases. In edge cases, the system is pushed to its limits. In corner cases, multiple parameters are pushed to their limits simultaneously.

Improve the reliability, stability, and performance of your system and reduce the risk of failures or crashes in production.

Save time and resources by automating the testing process and potentially reducing the need for manual testing or human intervention.
